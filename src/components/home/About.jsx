        I'm currently employed at the <b>Institute of Behavior Change</b> as a{" "}
        <i>Therapeutic Staff Support</i>. I work with children on the autism
        spectrum and those who have ADHD. I spent the past 15 months serving the
        community and working with children. My intentions are best articulated
        by this quote from Mahatma Gandhi:
        <i>
          â€œThe best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of
          others."

      <p className="about-title">Current Goals:</p>
      <p className="about-body">
        I'm active applying to developer positions in Philadelphia. I practice
        code and design for 5 hours on average everyday outside of work. I'm
        currently learning Swift and iOS app development. I am open to enrolling
        in either an advanced, part-time coding or design bootcamp after finding
        employment.
