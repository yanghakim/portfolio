# portfolio (yanghakim)
This is my personal portfolio featuring a few selected projects I've designed and coded. 

This is the third iteration of its design. Each iteration came at a different point in my learning process and exhibit very different design choices, coding practices (becoming more DRY code), and varying levels of, sometimes unnecessary, complexity.

Check it out on: https://yanghakim.netlify.com/. Be prepared to wait a few seconds for the website to load for the first time, since Heroku puts to sleep sites that have not been used for over thirty minutes. (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours)
